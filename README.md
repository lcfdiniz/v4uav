# V4UAV

**About**: This is a complete system to assist human operator in power transmission lines inspection/maintanence routines with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
With the help of deep learning models, the program is capable of detecting the lines, estimating its position in relation to the drone and performing the designated action: 
tracking or landing in line. While tracking is fully autonomous, landing takes a human-in-the-loop approach, with (weighted) shared control between the algorithm and the human operator.

## Requirements

To run this program you will need an Linux OS (Ubuntu 18.04 recommended) and the following software installed:

- [**PX4 Autopilot**](https://px4.io/)
- [**Gazebo**](https://gazebosim.org/home)
- [**QGroundControl**](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html)
- [**ROS Melodic**](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- [**MAVROS**](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/mavros_installation.html)

The following (optional) software is necessary to run the program properly:

- [**CUDA and CuDNN**](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/02/03/how-to-use-opencvs-dnn-module-with-nvidia-gpus-cuda-and-cudnn/)

The link above also cover OpenCV instalation, the only aditional, non-native, python library you will need.

## Installing

After downloading V4UAV package to your catkin workspace, enter the following commands in Ubuntu terminal:

```
catkin build
. [PATH_TO_YOUR_CATKIN_WS]/devel/setup.bash
```

## Running

- **First terminal**: Run PX4 Autopilot

```
cd [PATH_TO_PX4_AUTOPILOT]
sudo no_sim=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
```
This will run PX4 Autopilot and wait for the simulator.

- **Second terminal**: Launch Gazebo + ROS

```
source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
roslaunch v4uav gazebo_ros.launch
```

The `assets/gazebo/models` directory needs to be added to the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment variable. It should be [PATH_TO_PX4_AUTOPILOT]/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models.

- **Third terminal**: Run QGroundControl

```
cd [PATH_TO_QGROUNDCONTROL]
./QGroundControl.AppImage
```

- **Fourth terminal**: Launch V4UAV

```
roslaunch v4uav v4uav.launch
```

You are ready to go! All the program logging will be displayed in the fourth terminal. The following window (V4UAV interface) will pop up:

## How it works

The interface has two major portions: Commander and Controller.

- The **Commander** sends specific commands to the program, such as takeoff, go to position, and return to land. This will be better explained sooner.
- The **Controller** controls the vehicle velocity in X, Y and Z (body frame) and yaw rate.

### Commander

In this frame, you have to set a V4UAV mode and up to four inputs. The following modes are available:

| mode | description | input 1 | input 2 | input 3 | input 4 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| TAKEOFF | Takeoff the drone to a certain altitude | Z position (m) | x | x | x |
| SET_POS | Set the vehicle global position | X position (m) |  Y position (m) | Z position (m) | Yaw angle (rad) |
| SET_REL_POS | Set offsets on drone's position | X offset (m) |  Y offset (m) | Z offset (m) | Yaw offset (rad) |
| HOLD | Hold the drone at current position | x | x | x | x |
| GET_POS | Get the drone's current position | x | x | x | x |
| TRACKING | Enable power transmission lines tracking | x | x | x | x |
| LANDING | Land in power transmission lines | x | x | x | x |
| MANUAL | Control the drone's movement manually | x | x | x | x |
| RTL | Return to starting position and land | x | x | x | x |

### Controller

You may control the vehicle's velocity in X, Y and Z and yaw rate using the controller. You will observe that the Scales are standardized (from -1 to +1). 
In practice, this values are multiplied by the corresponding max velocity/rate param (take a look at the parameters file, `config/params.yaml`, section `interface`).

You could also use the keyboard!

| key | effect | variable |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| W | +0.1 | X |
| S | -0.1 | X |
| D | +0.1 | Y |
| A | -0.1 | Y |
| I | +0.1 | Z |
| K | -0.1 | Z |
| L | +0.1 | Yaw |
| J | -0.1 | Yaw |

## Results

The picture below show the vehicle landing in the power transmission line. With V4UAV, you will be able to safely navigate the drone through the lines and also land on it.
This can make inspection/maintenence routines faster, safer and more effective!
